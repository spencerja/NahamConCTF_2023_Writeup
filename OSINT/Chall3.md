----------------------------------
We are now in a park. Notably, there are large buildings on all sides of the park. We must be in not only a major city, but a city with a sizeable space dedicated to a grassy open park. My first inclination is New York City with its quite sizeable Central Park. Checking the terrain map, the Sheep Meadow location is a wide grassy area. I look for a street view and know right away that this is a match.
